<p>There are two ways to annotate in Aikuma.</p>

    <p>1. You can choose to hold down the control-key to play. You will see a green region that grows larger as you continue to play.
The current annotation is based on what's in the box. If you let go and press the control-key again, it will rewind so you can
hear the recording again. When you press return, the annotation is saved and you can move on.</p>

    <p>Press and hold left and right-arrow keys will skip back or fast forward. Escape-key deletes the previous region and annotation.</p>

    <p>2. If you have made recorded 'respeaking' or translations, you can select those as a basis for your annotations. When
you do, several regions will appear. You can play the current annotation by tapping the control key. Playback will
stop at the end of the current region. If you tap control again, the region will play again.</p>

    <p>Additionally, you can also listen to the respeaking or translation recordings for this region. The speaker button opens
a menu so you can select which recordings you want to listen to, if you want them to loop and so on.</p>

    <p>Tap Left and right-arrow keys to go to previous and next regions. Escape-key deletes the previous region and annotation.</p>
