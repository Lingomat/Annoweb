    <p class="md-body-2">Were working on better documentation but for now, you can get started as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="md-body-1">If you haven't added a user, do so. An anonymous user will be added, click profile edit on the top right to change name if you wish. Click the user to log in.</li>
        <li class="md-body-1">Now press the session button (+) and select the microphone to record (or click the button below). Alternatively select the folder icon open a recording you have already made.</li>
        <li class="md-body-1">You will now see the session overview page. You can edit many details here and make up your own 'tags' to describe the recording.</li>
        <li class="md-body-1">You can choose to do a spoken translation or even a careful 'respeak' to help someone annotate (transcribe) later by clicking on the respeaking and translation buttons underneath the waveform.</li>
        <li class="md-body-1">At the bottom of the session page you make add any number of annotations. After they appear, click on them to enter the annotation view.</li>
        <li class="md-body-1">Further help is available on the annotation view page.</li>
    </ol>
