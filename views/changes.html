    <p>Alpha 13. Person and tag selectors are now directives. They act directly on the mockService data. mockService updated to work on actual data structures, added example methods to add tags to user pool etc. Renamed all project and primary references to session and source. Rudimentary thumbnail handling.
    </p>

    <h4>23/2/2016</h4>
    <p>Alpha 12. Removed old keyboard filter in app.js. Moved nav-bar to a directive. Moved view controllers out of directives and into the states as set out in app.src. Home page implemented with mockService. Home page accounts for being logged in and out. Status page. UI routing parameter parsing implemented for status page. Fixed nav bar buttons at last, had to hack with CSS.
    </p>

    <p>Alpha 11. Firebase removed ;-/ Removed many redundant pages and directives, more to follow. Moved more templates into templates subfolder for clarity. Implemented Facebook login. AWS federated login still requires that you use the FB SDK, so
        I went ahead and implemented that. It's done purely from the navbar rather than the login page (deprecated). </p>
</div>

    <h4>17/2/2016</h4>
    <p>Alpha 10. Dist build works again, hooray! Implemented a Firebase service. Inserted a toy chat feature to test. Implemented a Firebase auto service and set up Facebook (more to follows). Reworked nav menu and removed controllers to new annoweb-viewcontrollers.js. Imported some cool CSS animations, using an attractor for the Login icon when the user is not logged in.</p>
</div>

    <h4>15/2/2016</h4>
    <p>Alpha 9. Implemented the shell of a full app with a side-nav bar. The side-nav is in the index now. Moved from ng-route to UI Router. Removed menu from edit interface. Implemented a breadcrumb toolbar. </p>
</div>

<h4>9/2/2016</h4>
<p>Alpha 8. Further improvements to edit interface. Region colours are gone, now we just use one colour to indicate the current region. Styled the region boxes to show some borders. Mousing over will draw boxes around regions. Clicking on regions will move to the selected region. Implemented the return-key logic,
    e.g. if there are further active annotations, move focus to the next one. Only create region on hitting enter on the last active annotation. Trimmed start/end times to one decimal place. Implemented split region, but the UI does strange things when you do it.
</p>
</div>
<h4>5/2/2016</h4>
<p>Alpha 7. Good lord, it looks almost usable! Fixed up the new annotation dialog. Add new button behavior, logic on the options with allowances for conflicting options. Implemented a directive to handle focus, now when annotation starts input is
    focused, and we will now be able to control focus shifts. Fixed a few bugs in the annotation controller, wired up the region progress bar but I don't like it. How about a circular progress marker on the left?
    Wired up the repeat button. Implemented an alert scheme in the AnnowebDialog service, both large dialogs and pop up toasts.
    Added a couple of basic error checks such as trying to add a region without advancing play cursor. Added hotkey for viewing hotkey cheat sheet which works in the text input (the default ? is disabled in the text input). Tell the user this on start with a toast.
    To do: Implement region split in the middle (currently only do split last).
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <h4>4/2/2016</h4>
    <p>Alpha 6. Added debug levels for loading file, dummy data (AnnowebService.debuglevel). Provision for at least two editing modes, simple continuous like Simple ELAN and a more complicated mode where the user has finer control over regions.
        Changed annotation option system to allow for logic on user selects, e.g. disable continuous mode if the user is using autoregions. Moved hotkeys into annotation controller (annotation directive is now ng-if to the annotation tab, moving away from
        this tab removes the entire element from the DOM and the hotkeys. This will have ramifications as it means the controller is being destroyed and re-created as well. Reorganised annotation into a separate module
        and added a controller for the edit view with minimal responsibility to set 'editable' status and to offer a button for the new annotation dialog. edit-tab-annotation deleted, new edit-annotation-simple and annoweb-annotation.js module.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <h4>3/2/2016</h4>
    <p>Alpha 5. Made source files minification safe (related to angular), some code cleanup. Dist build now works. Reworded annotation interface, previous and next summary lines now display the annotation which is currently has focus. Simpler parent layout avoids weird content resizing issues. Many JSHint issues fixed. Temporarily dropped in roboto font fetched via the web (we need locally installed). </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <h4>1/2/2016</h4>
    <p>Alpha 4. Implemented first pass at the editing interface. Now full browser screen. Implemented a system for keystroke binding. First pass at behavior when hitting return, will pass to new region. Currently there's no way to create regions, they are just extracted automatically for now. The enable/disable sliders are intended to let the user temporarily disable a type of annotation so that they can streamline moving on to the next segment. Repeat icon inserted, intended to toggle region playback repeating - will probably become multi-modal, such as two-repeats or endlessly-repeat.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <h4>31/01/2016</h4>
    <p> Alpha 3. Implemented ngRoute views. The edit view is the only one fleshed out and serves the edit-main.html. Now all edit view directives and their controllers are in annoweb-edit.js. Removed tab controller and placed mark up directly in the edit-main.html file. Removed placeholder tabs. Tabs relocated to the top of the page, waveform is only displayed in annotation tab. The net result is that the metadata tab will essentially be a full-screen sub-view.
        Menu bar trimmed to essentials. This may be replaced by a side nav but it will live in the same place for markup purposes. AnnowebService moved into annoweb-service.js. Now there is no general controller for the edit view, only controllers for directives. Removed all in-line controller definitions in favour of the best-practice named functions (at the bottom of annoweb-edit.js). View templates now have a systematic filename of view-type-name such as edit-tab-annotate which describes the annotation tab in the edit view.
    </p>
    <p>Side note: I looked at UI Route which offers the ability to route states of the app and not just views. This looked promising but complex, so the simpler ngRoute was used for now. UI route may be a better long term solution, particularly for persisting application states across sessions.
    </p>

    <h4>27/01/2016</h4>
    <p>Alpha 2. Reworked project to be handled with a build chain. Removed all left-over libraries, changed directory structure. Some things are ugly because they still depend on bootstrap css which I've removed. New readme.txt to describe project structure. Directory also has dependency source trees for node and bower. Perhaps I can move them to a parent directory?  Also found that wavesurfer's minimap starts to do auto scrolling weird stuff if I enable a flexible layout. The minimap already has other bugs, I think I'll fork it.
    </p>

<div class="row">
    <h4>24/01/2016</h4>
    <p>Implemented AnnowebService to handle communications between directives. The model is to call a method on the service to do something, like load a file. The service will broadcast to necessary components. It also holds
        the common data such as regions and annotations. This provided the solution for how to initialise the app. The wavesurfer directive has a timeout function with 0-time. This is a reasonable way to decide the wavesurfer directive is ready, so we call an AnnowebService method and that handles telling the other components what to do, including the annotation display (shortly to be an editor!). Fixed a bug in the wavesurfer minimap plugin that would not correctly refresh on new file. A good day's work.
    </p>

    <h4>23/01/2016</h4>
    <p>Dumped bootstrap. Annoweb will now use material design. This is surprisingly difficult but a) looks better and b) is particularly robust for changes in screen size. First major feature is a fully functional
        menu bar. Not clear if this is better than left-side pull-in menu. Implemented mainly because the example code on Angular Material also showed off snazzy ways to register key shortcuts which seems to be highly desirable.
        A bit of hacking is required to make file dialog open (you need a hiden input field). The main controller will now handle menu inputs, intialization and so on.</p>
    </p>

<div class="row">
    <h4>22/01/2016</h4>
    <p>It's time to deal with the structure properly, the main app logic should be stated in easy-to-read code which then instructs other modules to do what's required. First step is to transition to
        best practice according to the AngularJS community style guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <h4>21/01/2016</h4>
    <p>Investigated ui grid, decided I don't like it again and removed it (lol). Implemented bare-bones table-based annotation description. Discovered limitations in wavesurfer regions handling (not possible to iterate over data set). Impetus to move transcription data to a factory. Wavesurfer regions are now merely duplicates of annotation data for the purposes of visualisation only.</p>
