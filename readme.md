# Annoweb #

A web-app (and Chrome packaged app) for recording and annotating speech. Annoweb is intended is intended to help people record and translate speech, by means of making additional audio recordings and/or producing written annotations. 

Current status: Alpha. Several components are functional but it cannot currently be used to do meaningful work. (Soon!)

Annoweb is not intended to be an alternative to fully-featured software packages such as ELAN. The goals are:

1. Intuitively easy-to-use by anyone without specialist linguistic training
2. Use of web technologies; cross-platform, sustainable
3. Installable as a local 'app' via Chrome Packaged App
4. Based on Material Design to accomodate touch-screen devices, tablets and eventually mobile phones
5. Focus on sharing content to social platforms, e.g. exporting captions for YouTube

### Annoweb is part of the Aikuma Project ###

Annoweb is part of the [Aikuma project](http://www.aikuma.org), an international research and development effort to design and build tools for collaborative language documentation. Our tools may be of use to linguists undertaking language documentation, particularly those wishing to scale up their efforts to incorporate collaboration or crowdsourcing. However a major goal of the Aikuma project is to develop a new class of socially-connected tool for laypersons, such as participants incommunity-based language revitalisation projects.
