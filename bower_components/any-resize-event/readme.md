Any HTML Element Resize Event
================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/legomushroom/resize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/legomushroom/resize)

Adds **onresize** event to any html element(without timer*). It is tiny (about 800 bytes min + gzip) and dependency free.

_*timer is used as a fallback for elements that can not have child nodes(images, inputs etc)_

### Usage

Just link source file in your html. Add **onresize** event listener to any element as you usually do. Plays well with jquery too. [sandbox](http://codepen.io/sol0mka/pen/FnizC)

###Contibuting

Pull request is way to go. Uses coffeescript as js preprocessor so I'm expecting changes in **any-resize-event.coffee** file.

### Environment
Uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as task runner.
```sh
[sudo] npm istall
```
launch gulp:
```sh
gulp
```
### Tests
Please test your code. [KarmaJS](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) as tests enviroment and [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) as testing framework.
Launch testem:
```sh
karma start
```
You are all set.
