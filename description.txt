Aikuma-NG is an easy-to-use offline application for anyone interested in annotating, translating and organising spoken language. The app imports recording files or records audio directly. You may also record speech-based annotations to assist in producing transcriptions. Aikuma-NG also provides the ability to organise sessions with user-configurable details (metadata) such as images, people (speakers etc) and so on.

Our goal is to create a tool which is useful for communities with lesser resourced (endangered) languages. Aikuma is intended to be an easy-to-use alternative to complex software. A typical use case may include producing captioned video recordings for language maintenance, teaching and revitalization.

Aikuma-NG beta allows the user to do the following:

1. Record audio from a computer with a microphone or import audio from a WAV, MP3 or M4A file (such as from a mobile phone).
2. Produce 'respeaking' and 'translation' audio annotations to assist the production of written transcriptions.
3. Record details (or metadata) for a given 'session', such as participants, genres of speech and any number of user definable fields, uploading of images and so on.
4. Create any number of written annotations for the given source recording and perform these annotations listening to source and optional audio annotations.
5. Export the annotations to SRT or WebVTT file formats suitable for uploading to YouTube and other sites.
6. Export entire sessions to Elan (zip file with source recording and Elan multi-tier EAF file).

Aikuma-NG has online help, look for the question mark icons.

Aikuma-NG is offered localized into English, Chinese (simplified and traditional) and Korean. Some help texts have yet to be translated. Please select your language via the icon on the top right of the app.

The Aikuma Project

Aikuma-NG is the product of the Aikuma Project, an international effort to develop scalable methods to document and revitalize the thousands of small languages still spoken in the world today.
This software is the evolution of Aikuma, an Android mobile-phone app described at www.aikuma.org. The name Aikuma means "meeting place" in Usarufa,
the language where the mobile app Aikuma was first used. Usarufa is spoken in the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea.
